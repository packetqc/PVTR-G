personal dev qt qml 4g monitoring app project while looking for employment.

My latest personal 4G project while looking for employment: again, while the 99th monkey out of my ADN was migrating coding knowledge to Qt C++ QML resulting a usable monitoring and forensic framework ready to build additional counter measures just in time for 5G rollouts and automotive security standard certification coming out ! My background of building monitoring, networking, back-end, front-end and security tools is quite ready for IoT next generations. Take a look a see, some advanced designer and coder may already recognized what as been implemented and is required for this type of application running smoothly with minimal fingerprint. Working on graphics, sms views, sim profile and hopefully adding some python sdk to autodetect noise around the channel the device just hop in. But for now sms and Internet are operational with regards to my provider I would love to enforce security at the access layer or perhaps secure automotive. Great project with Sierra Wireless technologies ! Come see next and lets schedule an interview ! :)
