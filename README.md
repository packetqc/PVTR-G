My latest personal 4G project while looking for employment: again, as the 100th monkey out of my DNA was migrating coding knowledge to Qt C++ QML resulting a usable monitoring and forensic framework ready to build additional counter measures all that just in time for 5G roll-outs and automotive security standard certification coming out !

My background of building monitoring, networking, back-end, front-end and security tools is quite ready for IoT next generations. Take a look at [demo](https://github.com/packetqc/PVTR-G/blob/master/pvtr-g.mp4) videos and see, some advanced designer and coder may already recognized what as been implemented and is required for this type of application running smoothly with minimal fingerprint.

Working on log filters, stats graphics, sms views, sim profile, include wireshark qt project, bring back positioning maps-in  and hopefully adding some python sdk to auto-detect noise around the channel the device just hop in.

But for now sms and Internet are operational with regards to my provider I would love to enforce security at the access layer or perhaps secure automotive.

GPS and MAP integration is on going. Strange gps coordinates to be worked on. All from Pineapple audit scan with map features project developped in 2016 could be included. Qt Quick 2 C++ and QML seems to have a good arsenal to complete a geomapping module that fits with this application.

Great project with Sierra Wireless technologies !

Come see next videos and lets schedule an interview ! :)
